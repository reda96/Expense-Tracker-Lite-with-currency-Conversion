     - shared folder to contain shared reuseable components
     - features folder contains screen components
     - core folder contains (services, models, guards)
     - styles.scss and assets folder contain global styles
     - I have used Signals and Behavior subject for state management, Angular Material for icons, UI Components and Json Server for Backend APIs

2- API Integration
